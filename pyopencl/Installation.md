# Installation

*pyCUDA on windows is a complete mess.*   

It requires:   
* Boost
* CUDA
* Numpy   

### Important points:   

### For Boost (windows)

* Precompiled Boost is available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/)   
* For compiling *bjam* note that bjam = b2, which is included in the zip.

### For CUDA toolkit installation

* Download CUDA toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
* If CUDA needs to install *newer* geforce experience and driver, then DO IT, otherwise it will break cuda installation.
