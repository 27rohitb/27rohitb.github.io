## Welcome to My Repo
I am an aspiring quantum computing computing scientist. Other than coding and doing physics, I ocassionally write poems without keeping grammer in mind, which can be found [here](http://27rohitb.blogpot.in). I would be updating my github page whenever I get time and with whatever new things i learn. Feel free to modidy and use it according to your needs, pinging me about the same would be really nice although it is not complusory at all.
