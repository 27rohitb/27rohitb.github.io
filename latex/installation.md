# Installation   

Without trying to re-invent the wheel, this guide is ONLY for people who want to install LateX on Linux OR WSL on Windows.   
I will assume you already know you have WSL installed, but in any case i have put some link on how to install WSL   

## Requirenments:   
   
* WSL   
* VScode
* 2-3GB of free HDD space   
or for linux-only: just free HDD space.  

## WSL + VScode installation:   
coming SOON
