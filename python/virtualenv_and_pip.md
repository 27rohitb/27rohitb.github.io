# Virtual Environment & Pip   

### Virtural Environemnet   

It is best to make a virtual environment for every new project, since some libaries, if installed togther can create conflict. Installing
them on system python is NOT a good move.

#### Creating venv for windows/linux:
```
python3 -m venv <path-of-installation>
```   

#### Activating venv on windows:
```
<path-of-installation>\env\Scripts\activate
```   

#### Activating venv on linux:
```
source <path-of-installation>/env/bin/activate
```

### Pip
   
It's package manager for python.
